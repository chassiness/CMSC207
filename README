ASSIGNMENT #2
Date Submitted: April 1, 2016, Pacific Time
================================================

Instruction: Make all web pages responsive.

I have already included and used Twitter Bootstrap in Assignment #1 so it was just a matter of removing fixed-width
 components and replacing those with responsive ones. The biggest problem I ran into was the sticky footer but I was
 able to finally fix it by looking at the example on the Bootstrap website.

By default, as in on desktop, my web page containers are set at a maximum width of 85%, forms at a maximum of 50%. I
 added custom CSS so that if the device's width is less than 768px (devices smaller than a tablet), the web page
 containers and forms' width are set to 100% to maximize space and reduce blank space.

Also, I changed the code for the deposit reports. I replaced the grid system with a table instead, to capitalize on its
 built-in table-responsive wrapper, which automatically creates a horizontal scrollbar for the table as the page width
 gets smaller.

Note:
---------
1) For convenience, I have created a public GitHub repository for this project's code:

ASSIGNMENT #1
Date Submitted: March 11, 2016, Pacific Time
================================================

Assumptions Made
---------------------
1) With regards to the instruction:
"Create a web-page that has a sample table of a deposit report of an employee with month picker. (Jan â€“ Dec)"

I assumed that the deposit report is supposed to be included in the Employee view, since this is not included in the
Admin menu items listed.

2) Backend functionality not yet required.


Design Decisions
---------------------
1) I decided to implement a MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, NodeJS) Stack Single Page Application.
Although the requirements for the assignment were only HTML and CSS pages, I decided to build the skeleton framework of
the application in preparation for possible backend requirements in the future.
2) Only AngularJS and NodeJS have been implemented so far.


Build Instructions
---------------------
Here are the step-by-step instructions, followed by the command to run in the command line:

1) Install NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/
2) Run the node server inside the project's main/umbrella directory
    node server.js


Home URLs
---------------------
http://localhost:8080/
http://localhost:8080/index.html
Both URLs redirect to login page.

http://localhost:8080/employeehome
Home page for employees.
Login page should redirect to this page if Employee role (functionality not yet included).

http://localhost:8080/adminhome
Home page for admins.
Login page should redirect to this page if Admin role (functionality not yet included).


Screencast
---------------------
I tried my best to document my coding process but I was not able to do 100% because Jing stops at the 5min mark and I
usually forget to restart it, especially during the times that I'm debugging errors. I coded everything in one day, that's why
all the *.swf files are the same date.

The project I kept on referencing during the screencast was my final project for IS226 (not 227 like I erroneously said
during the screencast), 2nd Sem last year under Sir Rein. I used a MEAN stack for it as well.

My husband was watching AlDub in the background (ugh) or playing NBA in his playstation thus the occasional fits of laughter/NBA soundtrack.
